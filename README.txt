Hi, I received the wf's letter with happy heart.
And I'm really happy to see my wf and daughter now.

1. Btw she's worrying about my health and my work, but pls tell her there is nothing to worry for me.
I'm healthy and working well, don't mind at all.
2. Focus on playing and eating of my daughter, and not pressure her to study.
3. I'll write the letter soon again.
